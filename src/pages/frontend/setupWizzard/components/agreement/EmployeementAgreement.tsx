    <p>The Employee agrees to be employed on the terms and conditions set out in this Agreement. The Employee agrees to be subject to the general supervision of and act pursuant to the orders, advice, and direction of the Employer.</p>
    <p>The Employee will perform all duties as requested by the Employer that are reasonable and that are customarily performed by a person holding a similar position in the industry or business of the Employer.</p>
    <p>The Employer may make changes to the job title or duties of the Employee where the changes would be considered reasonable for a similar position in the industry or business of the Employer. The Employee's job title or duties may be changed by agreement and with the approval of both the Employee and the Employer or after a notice period required under law.</p>
    <p>The Employee agrees to abide by the Employer's rules, regulations, policies, and practices, including those concerning work schedules, vacation, and sick leave, as they may from time to time be adopted or modified.</p>
    <h2>Employee Compensation</h2>
<p>Compensation paid to the Employee for the services rendered by the Employee as required by this Agreement (the "Compensation") will include a wage at the rate of $30.00.</p>
<p>This Compensation will be payable every week while this Agreement is in force. The Employer is entitled to deduct from the Employee's Compensation, or from any other compensation in whatever form, any applicable deductions and remittances as required by law.</p>
<p>The Employee understands and agrees that any additional remuneration paid to the Employee in the form of bonuses or other similar incentive remuneration will rest in the sole discretion of the Employer and that the Employee will not earn or accrue any right to incentive remuneration by reason of the Employee's employment.</p>
<p>The Employer will reimburse the Employee for all reasonable expenses, in accordance with the Employer's lawful policies as in effect from time to time, including but not limited to, any travel and entertainment expenses incurred by the Employee in connection with the business of the Employer. Expenses will be paid within a reasonable time after submission of acceptable supporting documentation.</p>
<h2>Place of Work</h2>
<p>The Employee's primary place of work will be at the following location:</p>
<p>Winnipeg, MB.</p>
<h2>Time of Work</h2>
<p>However, the Employee will, on receiving reasonable notice from the Employer, work additional hours and/or hours outside of the Employee's Normal Hours of Work as deemed necessary by the Employer to meet the business needs of the Employer.</p>
<h2>Employee Benefits</h2>
<p>The Employee will be entitled to only those additional benefits that are currently available as described in the lawful provisions of the Employer's employment booklets, manuals, and policy documents or as required by law.</p>
<p>Employer discretionary benefits are subject to change, without compensation, upon the Employer providing the Employee with 60 days written notice of that change and providing that any change to those benefits is taken generally with respect to other employees and does not single out the Employee.</p>
<h2>Vacation</h2>
<p>At our company, we recognize the importance of rest and time off to maintain employee well-being and productivity. Therefore, we allow our employees to take up to one week of vacation per year. However, since our company operates on a seasonal basis, we cannot afford to pay for any of the time that they are off on vacation. If an employee wishes to take a week off for vacation, they should notify their supervisor at least two weeks in advance, to ensure that the necessary arrangements can be made to cover their duties during their absence. During their vacation, the employee will not receive their regular pay, but they may still be eligible for any accrued paid time off, such as sick leave or personal days, depending on the company's policy. It is important to note that this policy is in effect for all employees and is not negotiable. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining our company's seasonal operations while allowing our employees to take well-deserved breaks.</p>
<p>The times and dates for any vacation will be determined by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Employee.</p>
<p>Upon termination of employment, the Employer will compensate the Employee for any accrued but unused vacation.</p>
<h2>Conflict of Interest</h2>
<p>During the term of the Employee's active employment with the Employer, it is understood and agreed that any business opportunity relating to or similar to the Employer's actual or reasonably anticipated business opportunities (with the exception of personal investments in less than 5% of the equity of a business, investments in established family businesses, real estate, or investments in stocks and bonds traded on public stock exchanges) coming to the attention of the Employee, is an opportunity belonging to the Employer. Therefore, the Employee will advise the Employer of the opportunity and cannot pursue the opportunity, directly or indirectly, without the written consent of the Employer.</p>
<p>During the term of the Employee's active employment with the Employer, the Employee will not, directly, or indirectly, engage or participate in any other business activities that the Employer, in its reasonable discretion, determines to be in conflict with the best interests of the Employer without the written consent of the Employer.</p> 
<h2>Non-Competition</h2>
  <p>The Employee agrees that during the Employee's term of active employment with the Employer the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, as employee, owner, sole proprietor, partner, director, member, consultant, agent, founder, co-venturer or otherwise, solely or jointly with others engage in any business that is in competition with the business of the Employer within any geographic area in or around Canada, in which the Employer conducts its business, or give advice or lend credit, money or the Employee's reputation to any natural person or business entity engaged in a competing business in any geographic area in which the Employer conducts its business.</p>

  <h2>Non-Solicitation</h2>
  <p>The Employee understands and agrees that any attempt on the part of the Employee to induce other employees or contractors to leave the Employer's employ, or any effort by the Employee to interfere with the Employer's relationship with its other employees and contractors would be harmful and damaging to the Employer. The Employee agrees that during the Employee's term of employment with the Employer the Employee will not in any way, directly or indirectly:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Induce or attempt to induce any employee or contractor of the Employer to quit employment or retainer with the Employer.</li>
    <li>Otherwise interfere with or disrupt the Employer's relationship with its employees and contractors.</li>
    <li>Discuss employment opportunities or provide information about competitive employment to any of the Employer's employees or contractors; or</li>
    <li>Solicit, entice, or hire away any employee or contractor of the Employer for the purpose of an employment opportunity that is in competition with the Employer.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This non-solicitation obligation as described in this section will be limited to employees or contractors who were employees or contractors of the Employer during the period that the Employee was employed by the Employer.</p>

  <h2>Confidential Information</h2>
  <p>The Employee acknowledges that, in any position the Employee may hold, in and as a result of the Employee's employment by the Employer, the Employee will, or may, be making use of, acquiring or adding to information which is confidential to the Employer (the "Confidential Information") and the Confidential Information is the exclusive property of the Employer.</p>
  <p>The Confidential Information will include all data and information relating to the business and management of the Employer, including but not limited to, proprietary and trade secret technology and accounting records to which access is obtained by the Employee, including Work Product, Computer Software, Other Proprietary Data, Business Operations, Marketing and Development Operations, and Customer Information.</p>

The Employee agrees not to divulge, reveal, report or use, for any purpose, any of the Confidential Information which the Employee has obtained or which was disclosed to the Employee by the Employer because of the Employee's employment by the Employer. The Employee agrees that if there is any question as to such disclosure then the Employee will seek out senior management of the Employer prior to making any disclosure of the Employer's information that may be covered by this Agreement.</p>
<p>The Employee agrees and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a proprietary and confidential nature and that any disclosure of the Confidential Information to a third party in breach of this Agreement cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for in money damages, would cause irreparable injury to Employer, would gravely affect the effective and successful conduct of the Employer's business and goodwill, and would be a material breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The obligations to ensure and protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information imposed on the Employee in this Agreement and any obligations to provide notice under this Agreement will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and will continue indefinitely from the date of such expiration or termination.</p>

  <h2>Termination Due to Discontinuance of Business</h2>
  <p>Notwithstanding any other term or condition expressed or implied in this Agreement, in the event that the Employer will discontinue operating its business at the location where the Employee is employed, then, at the Employer's sole option, and as permitted by law, this Agreement will terminate as of the last day of the month in which the Employer ceases operations at such location with the same force and effect as if such last day of the month were originally set as the Termination Date of this Agreement.</p>

  <p>If the Employee wishes to terminate this employment with the Employer, the Employee will provide the Employer with the greater of two (2) weeks or the minimum notice required by law. As an alternative, if the Employee co-operates with the training and development of a replacement, then sufficient notice is given if it is sufficient notice to allow the Employer to find and train the replacement.
  </p>
  <p>

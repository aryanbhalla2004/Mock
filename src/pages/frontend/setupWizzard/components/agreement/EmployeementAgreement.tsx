        At our company, we recognize the importance of rest and time off to
        maintain employee well-being and productivity. Therefore, we allow our
        employees to take up to one week of vacation per year. However, since
        our company operates on a seasonal basis, we cannot afford to pay for
        any of the time that they are off on vacation. If an employee wishes to
        take a week off for vacation, they should notify their supervisor at
        least two weeks in advance, to ensure that the necessary arrangements
        can be made to cover their duties during their absence. During their
        vacation, the employee will not receive their regular pay, but they may
        still be eligible for any accrued paid time off, such as sick leave or
        personal days, depending on the company's policy. It is important to
        note that this policy is in effect for all employees and is not
        negotiable. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in
        maintaining our company's seasonal operations while allowing our
        employees to take well-deserved breaks.
